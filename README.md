Delta Calculator GUI Application
This repository contains a simple Delta Calculator built with Python and Tkinter. The application calculates delta values based on user inputs for VIX level, Current Price, and a Moving Average (MA). The delta value is clamped between 0.12 and 0.20 and displayed within the graphical user interface (GUI).

Overview
This Python application provides a user-friendly interface for calculating the delta using the following formula:

scss
Copy code
delta = max(0.12, min(0.20, (VIX / 100) + ((Current Price - Moving Average) / Moving Average) + ((VIX / 100) * sqrt(30 / 365) / 2)))
The delta is calculated based on VIX, Current Price, and Moving Average inputs provided by the user.
The resulting delta is clamped between 0.12 and 0.20 and displayed on the GUI.
Features
GUI Interface: Built using Tkinter, with entry fields for user input and a result display.
Delta Calculation: Implements a mathematical formula to calculate delta based on input values.
Input Validation: Ensures numeric values are entered; displays an error message for invalid inputs.
Resizable Window: The window is resizable to accommodate different screen sizes.
Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure you have:

Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with most Python distributions).
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/delta-calculator-gui.git
cd delta-calculator-gui
Install dependencies (optional): If you're using a custom environment, you might need to install Tkinter, though it's typically included with Python:

bash
Copy code
pip install tk
Run the application: Execute the Python script to launch the Delta Calculator GUI:

bash
Copy code
python delta_calculator.py
Usage
Once the application is running, follow these steps:

Enter the VIX level:
Input the current VIX level (a volatility index expressed as a percentage).

Enter the Current Price:
Input the current price of the underlying asset.

Enter the Moving Average (MA):
Input the moving average value you are working with (typically a 50-day or 200-day moving average).

Click "Calculate Delta":
The result will be displayed on the GUI, showing the clamped delta value between 0.12 and 0.20.

Example:
Input Field	Example Value
VIX Level	18.5
Current Price	1250
Moving Average (MA)	1200
Result:

yaml
Copy code
Calculated Delta: 0.1648
Customization
Adjust Clamping Values:
If you want to change the delta clamping range, modify the following lines in the code:

python
Copy code
delta = max(0.12, min(0.20, delta_formula))
Window Size and Layout:
You can modify the window size, layout, and styling by adjusting the geometry() and grid() settings. For example, to change the window size, update:

python
Copy code
root.geometry("800x600")
Additional Calculations:
You can enhance the formula or add additional input fields for more complex calculations.

Error Handling
The application includes basic error handling for user input. If the user enters invalid data (e.g., non-numeric values), an error message is displayed in the result label:

python
Copy code
result_label.config(text="Invalid input, please enter numeric values")
This ensures the program doesn't crash and informs the user of incorrect input.
